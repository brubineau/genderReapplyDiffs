## Model Solutions


$$ W(t) = \frac{e^{(t+\ln(prb)-\ln(1+bg-b))\times(\frac{rb}{1+bg-b}-1)}-p}{\frac{rb}{1+bg-b}-1}$$

$$ M(t) = \frac{e^{(t+\ln(rbg)+\ln(1-p)-\ln(rbg-1-bg+b))\times(\frac{rbg}{1+bg-b}-1)}-p+1}{\frac{rbg}{1+bg-b}-1}$$
exp((t+(log(g*k-g*p*k)/(g*k-1)))*(g*k-1))

$$ \mathrm{PctF}(t) = \frac{W(t)}{W(t)+M(t)}$$

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
